# Introduction to Risk Management

## Overview

Before diving into complex configurations, it's essential to understand the basic concepts of risk management in trading. This tutorial introduces fundamental risk concepts that will help you make informed decisions when configuring your trading system.

## 1. Understanding Position Sizing

### What is Position Sizing?

Position sizing determines how much of your capital you commit to each trade. It's your first line of defense in risk management.

### Basic Position Sizing Concepts

1. **Fixed Position Size**
    - Trading the same number of shares each time
    - Pros: Simple to implement
    - Cons: Doesn't account for price differences

2. **Percentage-Based Position Size**
    - Using a fixed percentage of your account
    - Example: 2% of your total capital per trade
    - More flexible than fixed position sizing

3. **Risk-Based Position Size**
    - Position size based on potential loss
    - Formula: Risk Amount / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)

```python
def calculate_position_size(account_value, risk_percentage, entry_price, stop_loss):
    """
    Calculate position size based on risk parameters
    """
    risk_amount = account_value * risk_percentage
    position_size = risk_amount / (entry_price - stop_loss)
    return position_size
```

## 2. Basic Risk Concepts

### Risk-to-Reward Ratio

- Comparing potential loss to potential gain
- Example: 1:3 ratio means risking $1 to potentially make $3
- Higher ratios generally preferred (minimum 1:2 recommended)

### Account Risk Management

1. **Per-Trade Risk**
    - Maximum loss allowed on a single trade
    - Typically 1-2% of account value
    - Example: $1,000 risk on $100,000 account

2. **Total Account Risk**
    - Maximum exposure across all positions
    - Usually 5-10% of total account value
    - Helps prevent catastrophic losses

### Simple Risk Calculation Example

```python
def calculate_trade_risk(position_size, entry_price, stop_loss):
    """
    Calculate potential loss for a trade
    
    Args:
        position_size (float): Number of shares/contracts
        entry_price (float): Entry price per share
        stop_loss (float): Stop loss price per share
    
    Returns:
        float: Potential loss amount
    """
    return position_size * (entry_price - stop_loss)
```

## 3. Basic Configuration Concepts

### Essential Parameters

1. **Maximum Position Size**
    - Largest allowed position as % of account
    - Example: 5% maximum per position
    - Prevents overexposure to single positions

2. **Daily Loss Limit**
    - Maximum allowed loss per day
    - Example: 3% of account value
    - Helps prevent emotional trading

### Example Configuration

```yaml
risk_management:
    basic:
        max_position_size_percent: 0.05  # 5% of account
        daily_loss_limit_percent: 0.03   # 3% of account
        risk_per_trade_percent: 0.01     # 1% per trade
```

## 4. Monitoring Your Risk

### Daily Checklist

1. Check current positions vs. maximum size
2. Monitor daily P&L vs. loss limit
3. Review open trade risks

### Warning Signs

- Positions exceeding size limits
- Approaching daily loss limit
- Multiple losing trades in succession

## Practice Exercise

1. Calculate position sizes for different scenarios:
    - Account value: $100,000
    - Risk per trade: 1%
    - Entry price: $50
    - Stop loss: $48

2. Review your current trading and identify:
    - Largest position size used
    - Typical daily drawdown
    - Average risk per trade

## Next Steps

- Practice calculating position sizes
- Start tracking your daily risk exposure
- Begin implementing basic risk limits

Remember: Good risk management is the foundation of successful trading. Master these basics before moving on to more advanced concepts.
