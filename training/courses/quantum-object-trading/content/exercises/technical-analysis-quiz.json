            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is scaled from 0 to 100, with values above 70 typically indicating overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold conditions."

            "correctAnswer": true,
            "explanation": "Unlike the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which gives more weight to recent prices, the SMA calculates a straight arithmetic average, giving equal weight to all prices in the period."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When price moves outside the Bollinger Bands, it primarily indicates increased volatility. While this might suggest a strong trend or potential reversal, the bands themselves only measure volatility and deviation from the average."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The main difference is that EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to recent price changes, while SMA gives equal weight to all prices in the calculation period."
