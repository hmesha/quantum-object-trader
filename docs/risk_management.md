# Risk Management System

## Overview

The Quantum Object Trader risk management system provides comprehensive trade validation and risk control through multiple layers of checks and balances. The system ensures trades comply with position limits, portfolio exposure rules, stop loss requirements, and risk/reward ratios.

## Components

### 1. Position Size Management

- Maximum position size limits per trade
- Portfolio exposure limits as percentage of total portfolio value
- Dynamic position sizing based on risk per trade settings
- Validation against account buying power

### 2. Stop Loss Management

- Dynamic stop loss calculation using Average True Range (ATR)
- Maximum loss per trade as percentage of portfolio
- Multiple timeframe volatility analysis
- Trailing stop loss adjustment capability

### 3. Risk/Reward Analysis

- Price target calculation using multiple technical indicators
- Minimum risk/reward ratio requirements (default 2:1)
- Dynamic target adjustment based on market volatility
- Trend strength consideration in target setting

### 4. Portfolio Risk Controls

- Daily loss limits
- Maximum drawdown thresholds
- Trade frequency limits
- Correlation analysis for portfolio diversification

## Implementation

### Risk Validation Process

1. **Initial Checks**
    - Position size validation
    - Portfolio exposure calculation
    - Daily loss limit verification
    - Trade frequency monitoring

2. **Technical Risk Analysis**
    - ATR-based stop loss calculation
    - Price target determination
    - Risk/reward ratio validation
    - Trend strength assessment

3. **Final Validation**
    - All risk parameters must pass validation
    - Trade execution only proceeds if all checks pass
    - Detailed feedback provided for rejected trades

### Configuration

Risk parameters are configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
risk_management:
    position_limits:
        max_position_size: 100
        max_portfolio_exposure: 0.25
    loss_limits:
        daily_loss_limit: 1000
        max_drawdown: 0.15
    stop_loss:
        atr_multiplier: 2
        max_loss_per_trade: 0.02
```

## Usage

### Trade Validation

```python
# Example risk validation call
risk_result = trading_logic.manage_risk(symbol, position_size, current_price)

if risk_result['approved']:
    # Proceed with trade
    execute_trade(...)
else:
    # Handle rejection
    log_rejection(risk_result['reason'])
```

### Risk Parameter Response

The risk management system returns detailed validation results:

```json
{
    "approved": true,
    "risk_parameters": {
        "position_size_check": "Valid",
        "portfolio_exposure_check": "Valid",
        "stop_loss_level_check": "Valid",
        "risk_reward_ratio_check": "Valid",
        "compliance": "Approved"
    },
    "reason": "All risk parameters within acceptable limits"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Position Sizing

- Never exceed maximum position size limits
- Consider volatility when sizing positions
- Scale position sizes with account equity

### 2. Stop Loss Management

- Always use ATR-based stop losses
- Adjust stops based on market volatility
- Never override stop loss levels

### 3. Risk/Reward Analysis

- Maintain minimum 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio
- Consider market conditions in target setting
- Regular review and adjustment of targets

### 4. Portfolio Management

- Monitor total portfolio exposure
- Maintain proper diversification
- Respect daily loss limits
