# Trading Logic Documentation

## Overview

The trading logic is implemented through a multi-agent system using OpenAI's Swarm framework. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of trading, working together to make informed trading decisions.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Technical Analysis Agent

```python
technical_agent = Agent(
    name="Technical Analysis Agent",
    instructions="""You are a technical analysis expert. Analyze market data using:
    - Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
    - Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD)
    - Volatility indicators (Bollinger Bands)
    - Volume analysis
    Provide clear trading signals based on technical patterns."""
)
```

Responsibilities:

- Analyzes price patterns
- Calculates technical indicators
- Generates technical trading signals
- Provides confidence levels

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Agent

```python
sentiment_agent = Agent(
    name="Sentiment Analysis Agent",
    instructions="""You are a sentiment analysis expert. Analyze market sentiment using:
    - News articles
    - Social media trends
    - Market commentary
    Provide clear sentiment signals based on qualitative data."""
)
```

Responsibilities:

- Analyzes news sentiment
- Processes social media data
- Evaluates market sentiment
- Provides sentiment scores

### 3. Risk Management Agent

```python
risk_agent = Agent(
    name="Risk Management Agent",
    instructions="""You are a risk management expert. Monitor and control:
    - Position sizes
    - Portfolio exposure
    - Stop loss levels
    - Risk/reward ratios
    Ensure all trades comply with risk parameters."""
)
```

Responsibilities:

- Validates trade parameters
- Enforces position limits
- Monitors risk exposure
- Manages stop losses

### 4. Trade Execution Agent

```python
execution_agent = Agent(
    name="Trade Execution Agent",
    instructions="""You are a trade execution expert. Handle:
    - Order placement
    - Position management
    - Trade timing
    Execute trades efficiently while minimizing slippage."""
)
```

Responsibilities:

- Places orders
- Manages positions
- Optimizes execution
- Tracks trade status

## Trading Process

### 1. Market Data Processing

```python
def analyze_trading_opportunity(self, symbol, market_data):
    """
    Analyze trading opportunity using all agents
    
    Args:
        symbol (str): Stock symbol
        market_data (pd.DataFrame): Market data
    
    Returns:
        dict: Trading decision with status and details
    """
```

Process:

1. Validates market data
2. Converts data to required format
3. Distributes to relevant agents
4. Aggregates agent responses

### 2. Technical Analysis

```python
def analyze_technical(market_data_dict):
    """
    Analyze technical indicators and patterns
    
    Returns:
        dict: Technical analysis results including signal and confidence
    """
```

Components:

- Price analysis
- Indicator calculations
- Pattern recognition
- Signal generation

### 3. Sentiment Analysis

```python
def analyze_sentiment(symbol):
    """
    Analyze market sentiment
    
    Returns:
        dict: Sentiment analysis results
    """
```

Components:

- News sentiment
- Social sentiment
- Market sentiment
- Sentiment aggregation

### 4. Risk Assessment

```python
def check_risk_limits(trade_params):
    """
    Verify trade against risk parameters
    
    Returns:
        dict: Risk assessment results
    """
```

Checks:

- Position size limits
- Daily loss limits
- Portfolio exposure
- Risk/reward ratio

### 5. Trade Execution

```python
def execute_trade(trade_params):
    """
    Execute the trade
    
    Returns:
        dict: Execution results
    """
```

Process:

- Order creation
- Execution timing
- Position tracking
- Status monitoring

## Configuration

### Risk Management Parameters

```yaml
risk_management:
    position_limits:
        max_position_size: 100
        max_portfolio_exposure: 0.25
    loss_limits:
        daily_loss_limit: 1000
        max_drawdown: 0.15
    trade_frequency:
        min_time_between_trades: 300
        max_daily_trades: 10
```

### Agent System Configuration

```yaml
agent_system:
    update_interval: 60
    confidence_thresholds:
        technical: 0.7
        sentiment: 0.6
        combined: 0.65
    signal_weights:
        technical: 0.7
        sentiment: 0.3
```

## Error Handling

### Market Data Errors

- Missing data handling
- Invalid data detection
- Synchronization issues

### Trading Errors

- Order rejection handling
- Position limit violations
- Risk limit breaches

### System Errors

- Connection issues
- Agent failures
- State management

## Performance Monitoring

### Trade Tracking

- Entry/exit prices
- Position sizes
- P&L tracking
- Risk metrics

### System Metrics

- Agent performance
- Decision accuracy
- Risk compliance
- Execution quality

## Integration

The trading logic integrates with:

1. IB Connector for market data and execution
2. Configuration management
3. Logging system
4. Performance monitoring

## Usage Example

```python
from src.trading.trading_agents import TradingAgents

# Initialize trading agents
config = load_config()
trading_agents = TradingAgents(config)

# Process trading opportunity
result = trading_agents.analyze_trading_opportunity(
    symbol="AAPL",
    market_data=market_data
)

# Handle result
if result['status'] == 'executed':
    print(f"Trade executed: {result}")
elif result['status'] == 'rejected':
    print(f"Trade rejected: {result['reason']}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Handling

- Validate all input data
- Ensure data synchronization
- Handle missing data appropriately

### 2. Risk Management

- Always check risk limits
- Monitor position sizes
- Track exposure levels

### 3. Agent Communication

- Clear message formats
- Proper error handling
- State management

### 4. System Monitoring

- Log all decisions
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor system health
